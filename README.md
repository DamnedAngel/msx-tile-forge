# MSX Tile Forge
v1.0.0RC4

An integrated Palette, Tile, Supertile and Map Editor for MSX, built with Python and Tkinter.

## Introduction

MSX Tile Forge is a desktop application created to assist in the development of graphical assets for MSX2 computers and similar retro systems that utilize tile-based graphics and have specific palette limitations. It provides an integrated environment for designing 16-color palettes, creating 8x8 pixel tiles with row-specific colors, composing supertiles (e.g., 4x4, but dimensions are project-configurable) from these tiles, and arranging them into larger game maps. The tool aims to streamline the asset creation workflow for retro game developers, specially for MSX.

All project components (palette, tiles, supertiles, map) can be saved and loaded individually or as a complete project, using custom binary file formats designed for ease of use and integration into MSX development pipelines.

## Features

*   **Palette Editor:**

    *   Ability to save and load individual asset components (palette, tileset, supertiles, map) separately.
    *   **Automatic Startup:** The application remembers and automatically re-opens the last used project on startup. If it can't be found, a new blank project is created.
    *   Automatic tracking of unsaved changes within a project, with prompts to prevent data loss.
    *   **Recent Files Menu:** Remembers recently opened projects and individual module files.
        *   Use `Ctrl+R` / `Alt+R` to pop up the menus at the cursor.
        *   Use `Ctrl+1`..`0` / `Alt+1`..`0` to directly open recent items.
    *   **Persistent Window State:** The size and position of the main window, Usage windows, and editor sash dividers are saved and restored between sessions.

## Getting Started

This section explains how to set up your system and run MSX Tile Forge.

### System Requirements & Dependencies

To run MSX Tile Forge, your system will need the following:

*   **Python:**
    *   Version 3.x is required. The application has been primarily developed and tested with Python 3.12, but it is expected to be compatible with other recent Python 3 releases (e.g., Python 3.7 and newer).
    *   Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system and that the `python` (or `python3` on some systems) command is accessible from your command line or terminal.

*   **Tkinter (GUI Library):**
    *   Tkinter is Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package and is essential for the application's interface.
    *   It is typically included with most Python installations on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    *   On some Linux distributions, Tkinter (often named `python3-tk` or similar) might need to be installed separately via the system's package manager if it wasn't included in a minimal Python installation. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, you can install it by running:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install python3-tk
        ```

*   **Pillow (Python Imaging Library Fork):**
    *   Pillow is required for various image processing tasks, including displaying the splash screen and efficiently rendering graphics in the map and ROM importer views.
    *   If you do not have Pillow installed, you can install it using pip (Python's package installer). Open your terminal or command prompt and execute:
        ```bash
        pip install Pillow
        ```
    *   **Note:** If you have multiple Python versions or work with virtual environments, you might need to use `pip3` or specify the Python interpreter for pip:
        ```bash
        python -m pip install Pillow
        ```
        or
        ```bash
        python3 -m pip install Pillow
        ```
*   **platformdirs (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   This library is used to find the appropriate user-specific configuration directory on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux). This is the modern, standard way to store application settings without cluttering the user's home or documents folder.
    *   The application will function without it, but will fall back to saving the `settings.json` file in the same directory as the script, which may not be ideal.
    *   Install it via pip:
        ```bash
        pip install platformdirs
        ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Ensure Dependencies are Installed:**
    Verify that Python 3, Tkinter, Pillow, and optionally `platformdirs` are installed.

2.  **Obtain the Script:**
    Download or clone the `msxtileforge.py` script to your computer.

3.  **Navigate to the Script's Directory:**
    Open your command line interface (Terminal, Command Prompt, PowerShell, etc.) and navigate to the directory where you saved the `msxtileforge.py` file.
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/msx-tile-forge-directory
    ```

4.  **Execute the Script:**
    Run the application using the Python interpreter:
    ```bash
    python msxtileforge.py
    ```
    *   On some systems, particularly Linux or macOS where Python 2 might also be present, you may need to use `python3` explicitly:
        ```bash
        python3 msxtileforge.py
        ```

5.  **Optional Debug Mode:**
    To launch the application with detailed diagnostic messages printed to the console (useful for troubleshooting or development), use the `--debug` flag:
    ```bash
    python msxtileforge.py --debug
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    python3 msxtileforge.py --debug
    ```

Upon successful execution, the MSX Tile Forge application window should appear after a brief splash screen.

## Technical Description of Generated Files

All project assets are saved in custom binary file formats. Multi-byte numerical values are stored in **Big-Endian** format.

**File Format Versioning Note:**
Project component files (`.SC4Pal`, `.SC4Tiles`, `.SC4Super`, `.SC4Map`) now include **4 reserved bytes** immediately following their primary header information. The application can still open older files that do not have these reserved bytes.

### 1. Palette File (`.SC4Pal`)

*   **Purpose:** Stores the 16-color active MSX2 palette.
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Reserved Bytes (4 bytes):** For future use.
    *   **Color Data (48 bytes total):** A sequence of 16 color entries (3 bytes each: R, G, B, values 0-7).

### 2. Tileset File (`.SC4Tiles`)

*   **Purpose:** Stores definitions for 8x8 pixel tiles.
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Header (1 byte):** `num_tiles_in_file`. A value of `0` indicates 256 tiles.
    *   **Reserved Bytes (4 bytes):** For future use.
    *   **All Pattern Data Block (Total: `num_tiles` \* 8 bytes):** Pattern data for all tiles, stored consecutively. Each tile is 8 bytes (1 byte per row).
    *   **All Color Attribute Data Block (Total: `num_tiles` \* 8 bytes):** Color attribute data for all tiles, stored consecutively. Each tile is 8 bytes (1 byte per row). High nibble is FG index, low nibble is BG index.

### 3. Supertile Definition File (`.SC4Super`)

*   **Purpose:** Stores supertile definitions and their grid dimensions.
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Supertile Count (1 or 3 bytes):** If the first byte is `1-255`, it's the count. If `0`, the next 2 bytes are the count (up to 65535).
    *   **Supertile Grid Dimensions (2 bytes):** `width` (1 byte), `height` (1 byte).
    *   **Reserved Bytes (4 bytes):** For future use.
    *   **Supertile Definition Blocks:** Each block is `width * height` bytes, with each byte being a tile index (0-255).

### 4. Map File (`.SC4Map`)

*   **Purpose:** Stores the overall map layout.
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Header (4 bytes):** `map_width` (2 bytes), `map_height` (2 bytes).
    *   **Reserved Bytes (4 bytes):** For future use.
    *   **Map Data (Variable size):** A sequence of `map_width * map_height` supertile indices.
        *   **Index Size:** If the project's total supertile count was > 255 at save time, each index is **2 bytes**. Otherwise, each index is **1 byte**. The application detects this based on file size.
