### Core Editors

-   **Palette Editor:**
    -   Manages a 16-color active palette for the project.
    -   Provides a full 512-color MSX2 visual color picker.
    -   Allows direct color editing via 3-bit (0-7) RGB values.
    -   Supports drag-and-drop to swap palette slots.
-   **Tile Editor:**
    -   Pixel editor for creating 8x8, 1-bit-per-pixel (2-color) tiles.
    -   Supports MSX-specific graphics modes by allowing each of the 8 rows in a tile to have its own unique foreground and background color.
    -   Includes a full suite of tile transformation tools: Flip (Horizontal/Vertical), Rotate, and Shift (Up/Down/Left/Right with wrap-around).
-   **Supertile Editor:**
    -   Constructs larger, composite "supertiles" by arranging 8x8 tiles into a user-defined grid.
    -   Provides a tile palette for painting tiles onto the supertile definition grid.
    -   Includes a full suite of supertile transformation tools: Flip, Rotate (for square supertiles), and Shift.
-   **Map Editor:**
    -   Designs large game maps by arranging supertiles on a grid.
    -   Features a zoomable canvas for detailed work and overview.
    -   Includes a real-time, resizable **Minimap** for quick navigation.
    -   Provides visual overlays for the Supertile Grid and a configurable "Window View" to visualize screen boundaries.

### Workflow & Productivity Features

-   **Undo/Redo System:** Comprehensive, multi-level undo and redo for all data-modifying actions.
-   **Usage Analytics Windows:**
    -   **Color Usage:** A dockable window that lists all 16 palette colors and details their usage count across all tiles.
    -   **Tile Usage:** A dockable window that lists all tiles and details how many times each is used and in which supertiles.
    -   **Supertile Usage:** A dockable window that lists all supertiles and details how many times each is used on the map.
-   **Drag-and-Drop Workflow:**
    -   **Reorder:** Tiles, supertiles, and palette colors can be reordered.
    -   **Swap:** `Ctrl+Drag` swaps the positions of two items.
    -   **Replace All References:** `Alt+Drag` replaces all uses of a target item (color, tile, or supertile) with a source item.
-   **"Deep Dive" Editing:** Double-clicking an element allows for quick navigation between editors.
-   **Advanced Copy/Paste:**
    -   Copies tiles and supertiles to the system clipboard in a self-contained format.
    -   Intelligently remaps colors and tiles when pasting between projects with different palettes or tilesets using the CIELAB color space and the Hungarian algorithm.

### Import/Export & Developer Integration

-   **Project & Module System:** Saves and loads projects as a set of interoperable component files (`.SC4Pal`, `.SC4Tiles`, `.SC4Super`, `.SC4Map`).
-   **Automated Build & Release System:** Implemented a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build, package, and release the application for Windows, Linux, and Debian.
-   **Import from Image:**
    -   **Project Import:** Can generate an entire new project from a single source image via `msxtilemagic.py`.
    -   **Tile Import:** Can derive and quantize a new tileset and palette from an image.
-   **Import from ROM:** Includes a graphical tool to scan binary ROM files and visually extract 1bpp tile graphics.
-   **Developer Export:** Can export project data to raw binary and generate assembly (`.s`) and C header (`.h`) files via `msxtileexport.py`.
-   **Standalone Helper Scripts:** Provides command-line scripts (`tilerandomizer.py`, `supertilerandomizer.py`) for programmatic asset manipulation.
-   **Versioning:** The version string is no longer hardcoded and is now dynamically inserted at build time.
